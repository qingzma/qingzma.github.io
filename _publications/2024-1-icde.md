Inductive Link Prediction (ILP) aims to predict
links for unseen entities in emerging Knowledge Graphs (KGs),
where a more realistic scenario is that unseen entities do not
emerge all at once but emerge sequentially in multiple stages.
Unfortunately, existing studies neglect the sequential-emerging
nature of KGs and simplify this scenario into multi-batch unseen
entities emerging simultaneously. Subsequently, two problems
arise and restrict the performance of existing methods: (1) lack
of the capability to model the long-dependency interactions
between entities across different stages; (2) unable to exploit
the incremental characteristics when KGs emerge in sequence.
To address the problems effectively, we dive into the practical
scenario formulated as Sequential-emerging Knowledge Graphs
(SEKGs), and propose a novel model entitled ISE2 (Inductive
Sequential Emerging Embedding). Specifically, ISE2 is composed
of the following two modules: (1) a relational graph-transformer
network is designed to capture long-dependency interactions with
the full-graph receptive field; (2) an adaptive attention mecha-
nism is developed to iteratively integrate emerging KGs into a
whole, fully utilizing the incremental characteristic in SEKGs.
Furthermore, a new benchmark that conforms to the data
distribution of real-world sequential-emerging is constructed.
The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ISE2
compared with the state-of-the-art methods in SEKGs scenario.
